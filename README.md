# Stochastic-Models-in-Epidemiological-Modelling
A MATLAB/Python project from university modelling a disease outbreak using stochastic techniques.

The .m files invilve methods for runing ODE SEIRDV infection models, a stochastic Gillespie SEIRD model and a Tauleap stochastic model. The run_model .m files use these base functions to answer the questions in the Worksheet, the results are written up in EpiAsses2WriteUp.pdf
